Small program for the ESP8266 microcontroller to detect and analyze wireless networks based on their signal strength (can be used to e.g. find the best spot for your router at home, etc.)

## Components:
* NONOS SDK Version: Basic implementation of the program based on the ESP8266_NONOS_SDK by Espressif (once with display (OLED SSD1306) output, once without)
* Arduino Version: Arduino port of the program
* UDP Testserver: Minimalistic implementation of a wireless access-point for the ESP8266 for testing purposes
